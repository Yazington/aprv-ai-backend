Introduction
2
Our brand design has evolved over the course of our brand’s continuous development. 
The result is self-confident and striking — and effectively reflects our brand positioning
and history. “The star always shines from above” is our guiding principle which describes
our aims for our design as well as the brand. The star stands for Mercedes-Benz. 
It shows us the way. This is why the star is always at the top in our new brand design.
This interim guideline presents the characteristic design attributes of our new brand
design along with a few application examples. Minor changes or additions may be made to
the document prior to the publication of the official BDS “Brand Elements” guideline in
November 2007.

review_description='The brand guideline emphasizes that the Mercedes-Benz star should always be at the top, aligning with their guiding principle "The star always shines from above." In the design provided, the star does not appear at the top central position but is on the chest area, which does not adhere to this principle. The design uses the star symbol prominently, featuring it on the shirt alongside the Mercedes-Benz text, but the placement does not align with the brand\'s specified positioning. The introduction of Tommy Hilfiger\'s branding is not addressed in the guidelines provided, making its inclusion ambiguous without more information. The guideline also mentions that minor changes could be made before the official release, but this doesn\'t excuse the current placement mismatch.' guideline_achieved=False

Brand mark – placement and mandatory buffer zone (asymmetrical brand mark, fixed spacing)
16
Application examples based on banner
If this amount of available space cannot be guaranteed for
specific media or formats, a minimum distance of 0.25 star
diameters must separate the brand mark elements from any
other graphic elements and the respective format edges. 
A mandatory buffer zone of at least 1 star diameter is
maintained between the brand mark and all other layout
elements or the format edges.

review_description='The design features multiple Mercedes-Benz logos placed closely to other elements, such as the Tommy Hilfiger logo, which does not adhere to the guideline requiring a buffer zone of at least one star diameter between the brand mark and any other graphic elements.

Based on the guideline examples provided (like the banner application), this design does not maintain the mandated buffer zones or spacing requirements.' guideline_achieved=False

review_description='The design includes the Mercedes-Benz and Tommy Hilfiger brand marks.

The primary colour Arrowsilver is generally used as a solid colour (Pantone 877) in our print
media. If it is not possible to print in Pantone, a colour gradient is created in CMYK instead.
Arrowsilver can also be used for the brand mark (forms, business materials) as well as
typography.

review_description="The design features the use of multiple brand logos, including Mercedes-Benz and Tommy Hilfiger. Regarding the color guidelines, the provided guideline specifies the use of the primary brand color Arrowsilver, which is described as a range from light to dark gray with a specific gradient angle in CMYK. The shirt design appears to have gray shades, but determining CMYK accuracy from an image is difficult. The guideline also recommends the use of Arrowsilver in print media, brand marks, and typography, but it does not clarify its application on apparel. Therefore, it can't be fully determined if the color usage in the design adheres to the guidelines. Additionally, no instructions or restrictions about logo placements or co-branding are included in the guidelines given, so compatibility cannot be assessed in this context." guideline_achieved=None

White is the preferred colour for use in the brand mark. The brand mark may only
appear in black in one-colour applications. The colours black and white may also be
used for typography. When selecting the colour for the brand mark or typography, 
it is essential to ensure that it creates a sufficient contrast with its background, 
at least 35%. Black is not used as a background colour.*

review_description="Upon reviewing the design against the brand licensing guidelines provided, I find several elements to assess.\\n\\n**Logo Usage:** The design uses the Mercedes-Benz and Tommy Hilfiger logos prominently on the shirt. The logos appear to be used correctly in terms of scale, space, and proportion as per typical brand guidelines, though explicit guidelines for logo usage were not given.\\n\\n**Typography:** The design should ideally use 'Corporate A' typeface as it’s the characteristic font for Mercedes-Benz communications. However, it appears that the font used in the design does not match the 'Corporate A' fonts (Light, Regular, Demi) specified in the guidelines. Hence, this does not align with the typography requirement given.\\n\\n**Combination of Brands:** The design effectively combines the branding elements of Tommy Hilfiger and Mercedes-Benz in a cohesive manner. However, without specific guidance on how these brand elements should be integrated, compliance cannot be fully determined.\\n\\nOverall, the major non-compliance issue is with the typography, where the specified 'Corporate A' typeface is not used in the design." guideline_achieved=False
